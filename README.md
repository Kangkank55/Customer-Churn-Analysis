# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry to understand why customers leave and to build a predictive model for identifying at-risk customers.

## Problem Statement
Telecom companies face high churn rates, resulting in revenue losses. This project aims to identify key factors influencing churn and to develop a predictive model.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Features: Customer demographics, service details, billing information, etc.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development and Evaluation

## Key Findings
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Higher monthly charges correlate with a higher churn rate.
